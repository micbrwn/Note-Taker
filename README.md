## Installation
 * Clone repository and open in VS Code.
 * Then in integrated terminal in VS Code:
    * Run  `npm init`
    * Run  `npm i`


## Usage
   After proper installation, open the integrated terminal in VS Code and run the command line `node server.js` or `npm start`. From there you will open the browser and go to the web address which runs the server, in this case its http://localhost:3001/notes. 

   You will then be brought to the opening page, and you will select get started. After that, it's very intuitive to figure out how to create and delete notes.
